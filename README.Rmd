This repository will contain the code, data, manuscript, and executables of a 3-rd year undergraduate streamflow modelling project taken in 2025. As of now, the project is incomplete.

Folder: Stan
This folder contains .stan txt files for each model, and the .R wrapper file to call them.
00: Wrapper file to call stan models from and define model settings.
01: Basic model using a gamma IRF.
01.2 Optimized version of 01, utilizing vectorization and the fast Fourier transform.
02: Version of 01 using a negative binomial IRF.
03: State-space version of 01.

Folder: Data Preprocessing
01: Imports data from Github and subsets it into manageable chunks.
02: Basic visualizations of the data.
03: Runs a change point analysis on the data using RBeast.

Folder: Data Postprocessing
01: Produces various diagnostic plots (including the options to call Shinystan) to assess model fit and posterior sample quality.
